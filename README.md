A quick guide to quickly set up a GNU/Linux environment from scratch, with dotfiles and scripts to facilitate installation and customization.

## Contenido / Content
- Post-Install [Fedora](./Fedora_PostInstall.md)
- [KDE Setup](./KDE_Setup.md)
- Dotfiles used in my installation

### Use and config
- Dotfiles are located in the `dotfiles/` directory. You should leave them in their respective user folders.
- Customize `.gitconfig` and `.zshrc` according to your preferences.
- Configure your KDE system and System settings.


As I incorporate more significant changes or improvements, I will update this repository, as I am interested in having a backup of the things I have accomplished during my first time using KDE and Fedora 43 as my main distribution.

If you like the setup and want to improve something in my dotfiles, I'm open to modifying it. So you can clone the repository and send me a PR about any changes or improvements.
